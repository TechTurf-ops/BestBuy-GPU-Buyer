# Simplified Stock Notifier  

A lightweight **Tampermonkey user script** that automates stock checking and purchasing.  

## Features  
- Monitors stock availability on any website.  
- Clicks the **"Add to Cart"** button automatically if an item is in stock.  
- Refreshes the page if the item is **out of stock**.  
- Opens a specified URL after adding the item to the cart.  

## How It Works  
- The script searches for common **"Out of Stock"** indicators.  
- If the item is available, it **clicks the purchase button** and opens a new URL.  
- If out of stock, the page **refreshes automatically** every 2 seconds.  

## Installation  
1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) on your browser.  
2. Add this script to Tampermonkey.  
3. Navigate to an online store and let the script handle stock monitoring!
